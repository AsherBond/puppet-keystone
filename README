These initial check-ins are just to save my current progress.

module for managing keystone:

Has only been tested on Ubuntu Natty

manifests:

init.pp

  contains the keystone class that can be used
  to install keystone from apt

dev/install.pp

  installs keystone from source and sets up a dev
  environment as recommended in the development guide

    http://keystone.openstack.org/setup.html

native types:

  I would like to create types to manage the configuration of
  keystone, including:

  - keystone_tenant
  - keystone_user
  - keystone_role
    ... I do not yet understand the below items ...
  - keystone_endpoint (templates or something
  - keystone_token
  - keystone_endpointtemplate

  The sole provider for all of these types is keystone-manage

  This has been problematic so far in that it does not fully
  support all of the operations needed by this type.

templates/initial_data.sh.erb

  contains a script that sets up an example environment
  that cloudbuilders was using for something (but for what?)
