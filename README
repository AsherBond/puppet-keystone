module for managing keystone:

Has only been tested mainly on Ubuntu Precise

Has only been tested with the essex-4 version of keystone

manifests:

init.pp

  contains the keystone class that can be used
  to install keystone from apt

dev/install.pp

  installs keystone from source and sets up a dev
  environment as recommended in the development guide

    http://keystone.openstack.org/setup.html

native types:

  I would like to create types to manage the configuration of
  keystone, including:

  - keystone_tenant
  - keystone_user
  - keystone_role
  - keystone_user_role
  - keystone_service
  - keystone_endpoint

  The sole provider for all of these types is keystone

  These types can only be run on the same machine where keystone is configured
