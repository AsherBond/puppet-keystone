deprecations:
  - |
    keystone::public_bind_host and keystone::public_port are now fully
    deprecated, and don't affect the correspoiding parameters under eventlet
    section.
    These parameters are currently used to generate public_host only if
    keystone::public_endpoint is not set. However, users should use
    public_endpoint instead because this generation will be removed in
    a future release.
