features:
  - |
    Added new ``manage_resources`` (default to true) in ``keystone::bootstrap``
    class that can be set to false to not manage resources created by bootstrap.
upgrade:
  - |
    If you're setting ``bootstrap`` parameter in ``keystone::bootstrap`` class
    to false you now also need to set ``manage_resources`` to false to keep the
    same behaviour.
