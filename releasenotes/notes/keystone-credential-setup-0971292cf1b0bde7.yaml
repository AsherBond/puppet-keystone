features:
  - Allow and enable by default the setup of Keystone credentials with keystone-manage.
    It has been a requirement in Keystone upstream so puppet-keystone will support the
    management of credential directory, keystone-manage credential_setup execution (can
    be disabled with enable_credential_setup boolean) and the configuration of
    credential/key_repository in keystone.conf.
