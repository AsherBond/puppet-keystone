deprecations:
  - |
    keystone::admin_bind_host and keystone::admin_port are deprecated and
    ignored as the correspoding options in keystone were already deprecated.
  - |
    Now keystone::admin_endpoint does not affect keystone configuration,
    as the corresponding parameter in keystone was already removed.
  - |
    keystone::public_bind_host and keystone::public_port are deprecated.
    They still works as valid hieradata to generate endpoint information
    used in keystone resource creation, but will be ignored in future.
    Use keystone::public_endpoint instead, which will be necessory option
    in the future to define public endpoint.
  - |
    keystone::admin_workers and keystone::public_workers are deprecated,
    and now are ignored.
