    The following puppet variables are deprecated and staged for removal.
    Keystone removed LDAP support for projects and roles in Mitaka. Even if
    these options are set in keystone's configuration file, they're silently
    ignored. We will remove these options in a future release:

      - ``project_tree_dn``
      - ``project_filter``
      - ``project_objectclass``
      - ``project_id_attribute``
