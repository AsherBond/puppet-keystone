features:
  - |
    Added keystone::bootstrap class.
upgrade:
  - |
    Now that the keystone::endpoint and keystone::roles::admin classes is deprecated
    and has no effect deployments must define the new keystone::bootstrap class with
    the proper data that was earlier passed to those classes. Please go through the
    parameters in keystone::bootstrap carefully and define the class.
  - |
    If you are using a multi-domain setup where you previously relied on keystone::endpoint
    and/or keystone::roles::admin to create your domains and domain scoped admin accounts
    the keystone::bootstrap does not do this and you need to ensure this is managed in your
    deployment using the keystone provider resources.
deprecations:
  - |
    The keystone::endpoint and keystone::roles::admin classes is now deprecated
    and has no effect. Please read the upgrade notes carefully!
