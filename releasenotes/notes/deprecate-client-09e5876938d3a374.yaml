deprecations:
  - |
    The ``keystone::client_package_ensure`` parameter has been deprecated and
    has no effect.

  - |
    The ``keystone::client`` class has been deprecated, because
    the python-keystoneclient package no longer provides CLI. Use
    the ``openstacklib::openstackclient`` class instead.
